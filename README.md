## Description

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager (the user) would benefit greatly from this application be being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. When the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. The user is able to sort the table by at least one category as well as filter by properties found in the list using keywords, phrases, names, or anything contained within the data.
